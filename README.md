# 🧠Mental_Health_Companion_Chatbot

## 📌Project Overview
This project is a Mental Health Chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The chatbot is designed to provide supportive, empathetic, and informative responses to users by understanding their text inputs.
The project demonstrates the practical use of Generative AI and transformer-based models for conversational applications, with a focus on ethical and responsible AI usage in mental health contexts.

## 🎯Objectives
- To apply NLP techniques for understanding user text
- To use machine learning–based language models for generating responses
- To build a simple conversational chatbot interface
- To explore AI applications in mental health support

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Transformer Models (Generative AI)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🤖 Machine Learning Usage
Yes, this project uses Machine Learning.
- The chatbot relies on pre-trained transformer models, which are built using deep learning techniques.
- These models learn patterns from large text datasets and generate meaningful responses.
- This approach goes beyond rule-based systems and enables contextual understanding.

## Key Features
- Text input processing using NLP techniques
- Context-aware response generation
- Use of pre-trained ML models for language understanding
- Simple and interactive chatbot workflow

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
- Clone the repository
- Install required libraries (such as transformers)
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file
- Run the cells step by step
- Interact with the chatbot through text input

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This chatbot is created for educational purposes only. It is not a replacement for professional mental health support. Users experiencing serious mental health issues should consult qualified professionals.
